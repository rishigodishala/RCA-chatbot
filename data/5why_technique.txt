# 5-Why Root Cause Analysis Technique

## Overview
The 5-Why technique is a simple but powerful tool for root cause analysis. By asking "Why?" five times (or more), you can peel away the layers of symptoms to reveal the underlying root cause of a problem.

## Methodology

### Basic Process
1. Define the problem clearly and specifically
2. Ask "Why did this problem occur?"
3. For each answer, ask "Why?" again
4. Continue until you reach the root cause (usually 5 iterations)
5. The root cause is typically a process or system failure, not human error

### Key Principles
- Focus on processes and systems, not people
- Each "why" should be based on facts and data
- Stop when asking "why" no longer provides useful information
- The root cause should be actionable
- May need more or fewer than 5 "whys"
- Can branch into multiple paths if multiple causes exist

## Example 1: Manufacturing Defect

**Problem:** Product has cosmetic defects

**Why 1:** Why does the product have cosmetic defects?
- Answer: The paint finish is uneven

**Why 2:** Why is the paint finish uneven?
- Answer: The spray gun is not applying paint consistently

**Why 3:** Why is the spray gun not applying paint consistently?
- Answer: The nozzle is partially clogged

**Why 4:** Why is the nozzle partially clogged?
- Answer: The paint is not being filtered properly

**Why 5:** Why is the paint not being filtered properly?
- Answer: The filter replacement schedule is not being followed

**Root Cause:** Lack of preventive maintenance schedule adherence
**Corrective Action:** Implement automated filter replacement reminders and tracking system

## Example 2: Equipment Downtime

**Problem:** Machine stopped unexpectedly

**Why 1:** Why did the machine stop?
- Answer: Circuit breaker tripped

**Why 2:** Why did the circuit breaker trip?
- Answer: Motor was drawing excessive current

**Why 3:** Why was the motor drawing excessive current?
- Answer: Bearings were seized

**Why 4:** Why were the bearings seized?
- Answer: Insufficient lubrication

**Why 5:** Why was there insufficient lubrication?
- Answer: Lubrication schedule was not documented or followed

**Root Cause:** Missing preventive maintenance procedures
**Corrective Action:** Create and implement lubrication maintenance schedule with tracking

## Example 3: Software Bug

**Problem:** Application crashes when user clicks submit button

**Why 1:** Why does the application crash?
- Answer: Null pointer exception occurs

**Why 2:** Why does a null pointer exception occur?
- Answer: User input validation is missing

**Why 3:** Why is user input validation missing?
- Answer: Validation was not included in the requirements

**Why 4:** Why was validation not included in requirements?
- Answer: Requirements review process was incomplete

**Why 5:** Why was the requirements review process incomplete?
- Answer: No checklist exists for requirements review

**Root Cause:** Lack of standardized requirements review process
**Corrective Action:** Create requirements review checklist and make it mandatory

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Start with a clear, specific problem statement
- Use facts and data, not assumptions
- Involve people who understand the process
- Document each step and the evidence
- Be prepared to branch into multiple paths
- Focus on systemic issues, not blame
- Verify the root cause by testing if fixing it prevents recurrence

### Don'ts
- Don't stop at symptoms
- Don't blame individuals
- Don't make assumptions without verification
- Don't skip levels of causation
- Don't accept "human error" as root cause (dig deeper)
- Don't rush the process
- Don't ignore multiple contributing factors

## When to Use 5-Why
- Simple to moderately complex problems
- When quick root cause analysis is needed
- When the problem has a clear linear cause-effect relationship
- As part of other methodologies (8D, A3, Six Sigma)
- For continuous improvement initiatives

## When NOT to Use 5-Why Alone
- Highly complex problems with multiple interacting causes
- When rigorous statistical analysis is required
- When the problem involves multiple systems or departments
- When more structured approaches like FMEA are needed

## Combining 5-Why with Other Tools

### With Fishbone Diagram
- Use fishbone to identify potential cause categories
- Apply 5-Why to each major branch
- Helps organize complex problems

### With 8D Process
- Use 5-Why in D4 (Root Cause Analysis)
- Provides structured questioning approach
- Documents cause-effect chain

### With A3 Problem Solving
- Use 5-Why in the analysis section
- Visualize the cause chain
- Support countermeasure development

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Stopping Too Early
- Symptom: "Why did the machine fail? Because a part broke."
- Problem: This is a symptom, not root cause
- Solution: Keep asking why the part broke

### Mistake 2: Blaming People
- Symptom: "Why was it wrong? Because John made a mistake."
- Problem: Doesn't address systemic issues
- Solution: Ask why the system allowed the mistake

### Mistake 3: Multiple Causes in One Answer
- Symptom: "Why? Because A and B and C happened."
- Problem: Loses focus and clarity
- Solution: Branch into separate paths for each cause

### Mistake 4: Lack of Verification
- Symptom: Assuming root cause without testing
- Problem: May implement wrong solution
- Solution: Verify by testing if fixing it prevents recurrence

## Tips for Effective 5-Why Analysis
1. Assemble the right team with process knowledge
2. Go to the actual location (Gemba) to observe
3. Use data and evidence, not opinions
4. Be patient and thorough
5. Challenge assumptions
6. Look for process failures, not people failures
7. Document everything
8. Verify your findings
9. Implement and monitor corrective actions
10. Share lessons learned
