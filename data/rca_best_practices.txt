# Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Best Practices

## Overview
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a systematic process for identifying the underlying causes of problems or events. The goal is to determine what happened, why it happened, and what can be done to prevent it from happening again.

## Core Principles of RCA

### 1. Focus on Systems, Not People
- Problems usually result from system failures, not individual mistakes
- Avoid blame and focus on process improvement
- Ask "What allowed this to happen?" not "Who caused this?"
- Create a culture of learning, not punishment

### 2. Data-Driven Analysis
- Base conclusions on facts and evidence
- Collect quantitative and qualitative data
- Use measurements, observations, and documentation
- Avoid assumptions and speculation
- Verify findings with multiple sources

### 3. Identify Multiple Contributing Factors
- Most problems have multiple causes
- Look for systemic issues, not just immediate triggers
- Consider human factors, equipment, materials, methods, environment
- Use cause-and-effect analysis tools

### 4. Distinguish Symptoms from Root Causes
- Symptoms are visible effects of the problem
- Root causes are underlying reasons
- Keep asking "why" until you reach systemic issues
- Test if fixing the root cause prevents recurrence

### 5. Implement Sustainable Solutions
- Address root causes, not just symptoms
- Ensure solutions are practical and feasible
- Consider cost, time, and resources
- Plan for long-term sustainability
- Monitor effectiveness over time

## RCA Process Steps

### Step 1: Define the Problem
**What to do:**
- Write a clear, specific problem statement
- Quantify the impact (cost, time, quality, safety)
- Define scope and boundaries
- Identify stakeholders
- Set investigation timeline

**Questions to ask:**
- What exactly is the problem?
- When did it occur?
- Where did it occur?
- How often does it occur?
- What is the impact?
- Who is affected?

**Tools:**
- Problem statement template
- Is/Is Not analysis
- Data collection forms
- Timeline creation

### Step 2: Collect Data and Evidence
**What to do:**
- Go to the actual location (Gemba)
- Interview people involved

- Collect measurements and samples
- Review historical data

**Types of evidence:**
- Physical evidence (parts, materials, products)

- Preserve evidence properly
- Document chain of custody
- Use multiple sources
- Verify accuracy

### Step 3: Identify Possible Causes

## Common RCA Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Stopping at Symptoms
**Mistake:** Treating visible effects as root causes
**Example:** "The machine failed because a bearing broke"
**Solution:** Ask why the bearing broke (lack of lubrication? Wrong specification? Excessive load?)

### 2. Blaming People
**Mistake:** Identifying human error as root cause
**Example:** "The problem occurred because the operator made a mistake"
**Solution:** Ask why the system allowed the mistake (inadequate training? confusing procedure? poor design?)

### 3. Jumping to Solutions
**Mistake:** Implementing fixes before understanding root cause
**Example:** Replacing equipment without analyzing why it failed
**Solution:** Complete thorough analysis before deciding on solutions

### 4. Insufficient Data
**Mistake:** Making conclusions based on assumptions
**Example:** "We think this is the cause"
**Solution:** Collect evidence and verify with data

### 5. Narrow Focus
**Mistake:** Looking at only one aspect of the problem
**Example:** Focusing only on equipment when process and training also contribute
**Solution:** Use structured tools to consider all factors

### 6. Lack of Verification
**Mistake:** Not testing if root cause is correct
**Example:** Assuming cause without validation
**Solution:** Verify by reproducing problem or testing hypothesis

### 7. Poor Documentation
**Mistake:** Not recording analysis and findings
**Example:** Relying on memory instead of documentation
**Solution:** Document everything throughout the process

### 8. No Follow-Up
**Mistake:** Not monitoring effectiveness of solutions
**Example:** Implementing fix and moving on
**Solution:** Track metrics and verify sustained improvement
